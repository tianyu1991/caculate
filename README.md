# calculate
One by one randomly select one item from stream[1,2,...,n] , calculate the maximum number of non-contiguous subsequences in this procure. For example, n=5,one of permutations is 1,5,3,4,2. Then the maximum number of subsequences is 3, when 1,5,3 are selected.

In code.r, the amount of numbers in the stream and the number of caculation needed are seted as n and num, while in code.cpp, those numbers are gaven by user.
