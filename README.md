# calculate
One by one randomly select one item from stream[1,2,...,n] , calculate the maximum number of non-contiguous sub sequences in this procure. For example, n=5,one of permutations is 1,5,3,4,2. Then the maximum number of sub sequences is 3, when 1,5,3 are selected.

In code using r, the amount of numbers in the stream and the number of calculation needed are set as variables. In code using C++ those numbers are given by user in  while it's running.
